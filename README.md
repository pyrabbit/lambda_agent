# README.md for Python Program Utilizing OpenAI Assistants

## Overview

This Python program integrates OpenAI's Assistant API to enable interactive chat sessions. It includes functionality for handling and responding to user inputs, processing required actions, and managing file operations.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Initiate and manage chat sessions with OpenAI's Assistant.
- **Run Handling**: Manages the status of runs and handles required actions from the assistant.
- **File Operations**: Functions for creating, reading, and listing files.
- **Command Execution**: Ability to run system commands and capture their output.
- **Test Runner**: Includes functionality to run pytest tests and capture their results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python library
- pytest (for running tests)
- structlog (for logging)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install openai pytest structlog
   ```

## Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable or modify the `api_key` parameter in the code.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

## API Key Configuration

Make sure to replace `api_key` in the `client = OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key")` line with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Functions

- `start_chat`: Starts an interactive chat session.
- `handle_run`: Handles the status of runs from the OpenAI Assistant.
- `handle_required_actions`: Processes required actions from the assistant.
- `create_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`: File operation functions.
- `run_tests`: Function to run pytest tests.
- `run_command`: Executes a given system command.

## Logging

Structured logging is implemented using `structlog`. Modify logging configuration as needed.

## Testing

Run tests using the `run_tests` function which is configured to use pytest.

## Disclaimer

This program requires a valid OpenAI API key and is subject to OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the program are welcome. Please ensure to follow best practices and maintain the coding standards.
